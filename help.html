  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <font color="#32aa08">Very Strong Homology: Identity &#8805; 70% or Positive &#8805; 75%</font><br>

    <font color="#fa1e00">Moderate Homology: Identity &#8805; 30%</font><br>
    For simplicity, we don't show all of the homologous structures in the PDB. To select matches for viewing, we consider 50 uniformly spaced positions across the protein sequence and identify the hit with the highest sequence identity nearby that site. If, for example, one PDB matches most of the sequence, we will still return up to 10 hits.

    <br>&nbsp;<br><b>A)</b> When the user places their cursor over an amino acid, the position is highlighted across all annotation tracks (vertical green highlight). Here we highlight A206. This is a site with a phenotype-associated polymorphic allele within a known topologic domain and for which homologous experimental structures exist. Further, it is a member of family of human sugar transporting proteins, each with their own set of similar annotations.
    <br>&nbsp;<br><b>B)</b> Zooming in on the region around A206, the specific and detailed data and annotations available within P2T2 more easily viewed.
    <br>&nbsp;<br><b>C)</b> The MSA shows that the alternate amino acid, T, is common in the family and is a known phosphorylation site (PTM type shown on mouseover).
